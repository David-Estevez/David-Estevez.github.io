Fish && Chips is a collaboration with the artist [Cristina de Propios](http://www.depropios.com/) to make an open source robotic fish that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing.

Several prototypes have already been built to test different aspects choices of hardware and electronics, as well as to study how to imitate the fish movements and dynamics. Future prototypes will address remaning challenges such as submerging the fish in water while keeping the electronics and batteries dry.
