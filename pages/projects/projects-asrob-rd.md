Robot Devastation is a Mixed-Reality game in which the player takes control of a real robot to fight against other robots with simulated weapons. 


It was inspired by combats of real robots (think [BattleBots](https://battlebots.com/), for instance). These robots are cool, but have two main issues: they are expensive to build (and will be probably broken after the combat), and they are very dangerous (as they are equipped with all kinds of weapons). Robot Devastation solves both issues with low-cost DIY robots that do not require heavy components or weapons, as the robots attach each other though Augmented-Reality. The destruction is simulated... but the fun is real!
