GECKO is a gesture recognition software that allows the user a basic control of the computer's cursor and click functionalities, as well as launching user-defined commands. It was implemented with my classmate [Irene Sanz](http://www.irenesanz.com/) as our final work for a computer vision undergraduate course.

The following video shows GECKO in action:
