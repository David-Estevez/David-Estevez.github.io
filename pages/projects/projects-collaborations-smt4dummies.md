SMT4dummies is a kit for learning how to solder surface mount components (SMD). It is composed of a PCB with simple circuits of increasing difficulty that can be assembled consecutively and allows for an easy way to check for soldering errors. The circuits are: a time delay switch, an SR latch, a push-switch operated 4-bit up-counter, a 4-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a PWM LED dimmer.

This project was developed within [d-squared:robotics](https://github.com/dsquaredrobotics), in collaboration with [David Antón Sánchez](https://github.com/davidanton) as a project to learn how to design PCB circuits. This project was used to teach ourselves how to solder SMD components during our time as undergraduate students in the Carlos III University of Madrid.
