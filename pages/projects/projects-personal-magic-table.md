The Magic Table is a multipurpose 2.5D CNC machine developed around an industrial H-Bot gantry manufactured by Festo. This project was part of my work at BQ labs, the R&D branch of the [Spanish company BQ](https://www.bq.com/en/).

The idea behind the Magic Table was to have a proof of concept of a DIY machine that could perform different tasks, such as plotting, light painting, product inspection with cameras / microscopes, interactive games with pieces moved by an electromagnet, etc.
