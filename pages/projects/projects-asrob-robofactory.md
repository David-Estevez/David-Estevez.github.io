RoboFactory is a work group within the UC3M Robotics Society (ASROB). 


It was initially created as a way to introduce newcomers to the basic knowledge required to build robots, develop some robots for [Robot Devastation](project-asrob-rd.md) and make use of the ton of materials that we have sitting around in our lab.

Currently it serves as a general group in which people with different projects that might now have enough people to become an independent work group can share a common space and help each other.
