Open source module for Modular Robots.



## Introduction
The REPY-2.1 is an open source mechanical module for researching Modular Robotics. It is designed to be printed on a Low-cost 3D printer, like a [RepRap](http://reprap.org/wiki/Main_Page). It improves the previous version ([REPY-2.0](research-modular-repy-2.0.html)) by adjusting the dimensions of the module and adding connectors on the sides of the modules, which allows to form modular robots with 2D configurations.

## Gallery
These are some examples of REPY-2.1 modules and robots made of REPY-2.1:
