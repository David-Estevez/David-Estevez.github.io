description: In this tutorial we will learn how to create a PySide/PyQt application. For that purpose, I will make a walkthrough of the creation of a graphical interface for the PCB outline creator for KiCad. The PCB outline creator is a small tool to add PCB outlines with some given dimensions (and rounded corners) to a KiCad file. It is included in the <a href="https://github.com/David-Estevez/kicad-library">kicad-library repository</a>.
