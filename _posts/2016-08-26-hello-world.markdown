Hello World!

This is the first post of my new website/blog. The idea behind the website is to serve as a nice front for my different projects stored in github and their documentation.  I'm also linking some tutorials that I have done, so that everything I have shared (code, docs, tutorials) can be accessed through my website.

As for the blog, for the moment I intend to use it mainly to track events I attend, news and that kind of stuff. But maybe I will also post things in development and other things that might be interesting, but that don't quite fit in the website.

Stay tuned!
