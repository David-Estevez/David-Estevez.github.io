description: As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I researched gait generation and communications in distributed Modular Robots. For testing, I also developed the [REPY-2 Module](link) and the [SkymegaSMD board](https://github.com/David-Estevez/SkymegaSMD) to build a Modular Robot to be used as validation platform for the algorithms.
