description: As part of my Bachelor's thesis, I researched gait generation and communications in distributed Modular Robots. For testing, I also developed the <a href="https://github.com/David-Estevez/REPY-2.0">REPY-2 Module</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/David-Estevez/SkymegaSMD">SkymegaSMD board</a> to build a Modular Robot to be used as validation platform for the algorithms.
